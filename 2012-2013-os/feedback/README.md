# Feedback materials

In this folder you will find a presentation I was showing on both feedback
sessions.  The format of the presentation is 
[terminal keynote](https://github.com/fxn/tkn), you need to have ruby installed
in order to launch it.

There were also a number of files that I was creating on the fly while the
presentation, but most of the stuff is useless to put here.  However, if 
anyone has strong opinions about something being missing here, please do contact
me.
