Welcome to the OpenCL course
============================

This is a course that we are teaching together with 
[Sven-Bodo Scholz](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~sbs) in 
Heriot-Watt university.  The assignment process is happening through
[vision](http://vision.hw.ac.uk), however here we keep materials
that mainly useful within the assignments or generally useful in
terms of OpenCL.

Here is a [link](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~sbs/homepage/main/Teaching/Entries/2012/9/3_Distributed_Systems_Programming_(F21DS).html) for Bodo's description of the course.

## Directory structure

Here are the materials regarding assignments, which can be found in
a folder `assignment-xx` and the files of the crash-course in C `c-course` that I
gave one day.

## Useful links
Here you can find some links that should help you through the course.

 1. Confident C knowledge is absolutely essential for this course.  Here is a
    [document](http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/jebari_chaker/papers/C_for_Java_Programmers.pdf)
    for people who are familiar with Java and want to pic-up C.
 2. The [OpenCL standard](http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/) -- use it 
    to consult the syntax etc.
 3. Khronos group have a [page with resources](http://www.khronos.org/opencl/resources)
    -- tutorials, books, etc.  Some of them ar very useful.
