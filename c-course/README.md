Summary
=======

Here you can find source files created during the mini-course in C.  This is
a simple implementation of binary search tree, where each node contains a
string.  Strings are being compared in lexicographical order.

We had a problem with valgrind reporting memory leaks, but it seem to be a 
fault of the valgrind.  After launching valgrind again without any changes
it reports no leaks.
